            <p>Implemented a PerfumeJS plugin in Android Runner which aims to measure several performance metrics for mobile web applications. 
                The main metrics focused in this feature were the following:</p>

                <ul>
                <li><strong>TotalTime</strong> which is the request plus response time.</li>
                <li><strong>DownloadTime</strong> which is the response time to a request.</li>
                <li><strong>First Pain</strong> which is the render time of any visual aspect different to what was on screen before navigation to the web page</li>
                <li><strong>First Contentful Paint</strong> which is the render time of the first bit of content from the DOM.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Additionally, performed an experiment to observe the performance metrics generated by the plugin on n 100 
                web applications randomly selected for which the above performance metrics are collected.</p>
