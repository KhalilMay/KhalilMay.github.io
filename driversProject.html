                Developed a driver distraction system that monitors the driver’s behaviour while driving and alerts him in case it detects any distractions. It allows a parent or a friend to also monitor the driver from the web application through a map. The system consists of two applications; Mobile App and Web App.

                <strong><i class="fa-solid fa-tablet-screen-button"></i> Driver Disctraction Mobile App</strong>
                <p>Mobile App developed in Android Studio using Java with data stored in Firebase. The application allowed the user to start a session when he starts driving, and during the session distraction mitigation measurement were made for the user to stop using the mobile device. The below are some main features in the app: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Screen touch detection to prevent the driver from using the device during the session.</li>
                    <li>Accelerometer sensor reading during the session to prevent driver from exceeding speed limit.</li>
                    <li>Voice message feature to automatically play a voice message sent from parent account.</li>
                    <li>Device location collected for parental viewing.</li>
                </ul>

                <strong><i class="fa-regular fa-window-restore"></i> Driver Disctraction Web App</strong>
                <p>Web App developed in Visual Studio using ASP.Net web forms with data stored and retrieved from Firebase. The web application will process data and send the results back to the mobile application. Also it will have a map to track the user’s phone location. Below are some main features in the web app:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The web app will process data received through APIs, on the web-based backend.</li>
                    <li>Data of driver's sessions are displayed to the web app user.</li>
                    <li>Web app displays driver's location in a map for parental user to track.</li>
                    <li>Web app allows parental user to send text message to driver which then the mobile app uses Text-to-Speech to play for the driver.</li>
                </ul>
