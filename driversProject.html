                Developed a driver distraction system that monitors the driverâ€™s behaviour while driving and alerts him in case it detects any distractions. It allows a parent or a friend to also monitor the driver from the web application through a map. The system consists of two applications; Mobile App and Web App.

                <strong><i class="fa-regular fa-mobile"></i> Driver Disctraction Mobile App</strong>
                <p>Mobile App developed in Android Studio using Java with data stored in Firebase. The application allowed the user to start a session when he starts driving, and during the session distraction mitigation measurement were made for the user to stop using the mobile device. The below are some main features in the app: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Screen touch detection to prevent the driver from using the device during the session</li>
                    <li>Accelerometer sensor reading during the session to prevent driver from exceeding speed limit</li>
                    <li>Voice message feature to automatically play a voice message sent from parent account</li>
                    <li>Device location collected for parental viewing</li>
                </ul>
